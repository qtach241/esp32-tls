# esp32-tls
TLS in ESP32 using Espressif IDF

Wise words from Kolban:

"Another old favorite ... is that when things suddenly stop working for no reason is to erase the flash using esptool. This returns the ESP32 to its factory default. On occassion, especially during development, we can corrupt flash storage or power off at "just the wrong time" and a reset of flash never does any harm."
